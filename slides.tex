\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Virtualized infrastructure}
\begin{frame}{Virtualized infrastructure}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.4]{imgs/samplecloud.png}
\end{figure}

We define QoS as the performance, the avaibilitity, etc. provided by
a cloud.
Virtualization in clouds allows to
\begin{itemize}
	\item Launch and stop services on the fly
	\item Replicates easily VMs running those services
	\item Facilitate administration
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Virtualisation and Cloud}
\begin{frame}{Clouds in business}
Large firms delegates their IT infrastructure to specialized companies
\begin{itemize}
	\item Reduction of the costs (less hardware to buy and manage,
		less software to write, etc.)
	\item Augmentation of the QoS
\end{itemize}
However, by doing so, those firms:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Lose control over their data
	\item Become dependent of another company
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Different types of services}
\begin{figure}[!ht]

\end{figure}
%BtrPlace works at the Infrastructure level.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{How is it done?}
There are different kind  of hypervisor,\\
\pause with different features,\\ % follow what the client want
\pause and different licences; % limitations on the ressources usable

Need for a software to manage at the Infrastructure level to place
a set of virtual machines on a set of nodes. % to provide services (redundancy)
\pause Would be usefull to teach this software about available hypervisor,
their fonctionnality, etc.
\end{frame}

\subsection{BtrPlace, a placement manager}
% détails, à supprimer (un item)
\begin{frame}{BtrPlace}
BtrPlace is a software that aimse to solve the problem of distributing a set of VMs on
a set of nodes efficiently, by following some constraints, while
being flexible. The constraints can be :
\begin{itemize}
	\item imposed by the hardware, such as available ressources
	\item given by the user, following his needs (eg. replication
		of VMs)
	\item imposed by hypervisors licences
\end{itemize}
\pause As it competitors, BtrPlace doesn't make the distinction
between different hypervisors. but designed to be extensible,
so it should be reasonably easy to augment it to support typing.
\end{frame}
\section{Adding typing in BtrPlace}
\subsection{Modelisation in BtrPlace}
\begin{frame}{Modelisation in BtrPlace}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.4]{imgs/config.eps}
\end{figure}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{\textbf{Type}}, integer associated to each hypervisor
	\item{\textbf{Deployment}}, operation of rebooting a node and
		eventually changing its hypervisor
	\item{\textbf{Reconfiguration}}, operation during which BtrPlace
		change the placement of VMs on nodes following constraints
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Proceeding of the work}
We worked incrementally by
\begin{enumerate}
	 \item modeling and implementing a special case of the typing
	 \item modeling and implementing the general case
	 \item implementing some constraints associated to typing problems
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\subsection{Special case}
\begin{frame}{Model}
\textbf{Hypothesis}: we know which nodes are going to change their hypervisor,
and the name of the new hypervisor.\\
\pause For such a node, the following constraints must be satisfied:
\[
	P(c) = n \Rightarrow c^\mathrm{ed} \leq D^\mathrm{st}
\]
\[
	P(d) = n \Rightarrow d^\mathrm{st} \geq D^\mathrm{ed}
\]
\pause Placement satisfied iff:
\[
	P(v) = n \Rightarrow T(n) = T(v)	
\]

\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Code}
This special case is implemented through a constraint
$Platform((n_i, h_j), (n_{i+1}, h_k), \ldots)$.
There are two main methods in this class:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item{\textbf{inject}}, which inject into Choco the two previous
		constraints
	\item{\textbf{isSatisfied}}, which ensures the injected constraints
		are indeed satisfied in the new configuration
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

\subsection{General case}
\begin{frame}{Model}
BtrPlace should now deduce the new type of the nodes.\\
We add a vector $v_i$ to each node. $v_i[t]$ represents the number
of VMs running under the hypervisor $t$.
\pause The placement is satisfied iff:
\[
	(\exists ! x \in v_i), x \neq 0
\]

Currently, only the model has been defined correctly, no working code.
\end{frame}

\subsection{Additional constraints}
\begin{frame}{MinPlatform}
$MinPlatform(nodes, type, n)$ ensures at least $n$ nodes from $nodes$ runs
hypervisor $type$.
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[scale=.4]{imgs/samplecloud.png}
	\caption{$MinPlatform((N1,N2,N3), "ESX", 2)$}
\end{figure}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{MaxVM}
$MaxVM(nodes, type, n)$ ensures at most $n$ nodes runs hypervisor $type$.\\
\pause Other PFE project proposed by Fabien in response to licence limitations
(VMWare notably) is easily implemented because typing is done with integer.

\section{Management}
\subsection{Problems encountered}
\begin{frame}{Timing management}
\begin{figure}[!ht]
	\includegraphics[scale=.2]{imgs/gantt2.png}
\end{figure}
\textbf{Problem}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item not enough time spent on timing the work; 
	\item incoherence in the DOW observed too late, % at the end of the project;
	% leading to badly structured reports.
\end{itemize}
\pause\textbf{Possible Solution}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item spend more time on timing and structuring the work % rather than others parts of DOW
	\item try to evaluate better exogenous elements (mainly other scholar works).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Complexity of BtrPlace}
\textbf{Problem} : only documentation available : API Java.
Inadequate and insufficient to understand fully BtrPlace.\\
\pause\textbf{Possible solution} : add two layers of documentation.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item one describing the general structure of the software, with
		some example
	\item and an other describing model generation and how to
		write simple constraints
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}

	\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{scriptsize}
\end{center}
\end{frame}

\section{To sum up}
\begin{frame}{New competences and technologies}
During this project, I learnt and revisited:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Java and related tools (maven, IntelliJ, unit testing)
	\item Management of ressources and combinatorial problems
	\item Choco framework
	\item Git
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{How to improve what has been done and time estimation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item add more test for the special case (2 or 3 hours)
	\item implement general case at the right place, not
		as a user constraint, and tested (difficult to estimate)
	\item describe underlying models for constraints \textit{MinPlatform}
		and \textit{MaxVM}; complete and revised the implementation
		following the new models (1 or 2 hours)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}{Possible evolutions thanks to typing}
Hypervisors licences and features can be pretty differents:
\begin{itemize}
	\item some allows migrating VMs, some don't
	\item some put restrictions on usable hardware (number of NIC, RAM, CPU usable
		by the hypervisor)
	\item etc.
\end{itemize}
Typing could help modelize those limitations.
